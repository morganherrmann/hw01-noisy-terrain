## Terrain
- With cartoons as an inspiration, this terrain system was developed using WebGL and TypeScript.  
- The user can move through various biomes using keyboard shortcuts (W/A/S/D), and can manipulate the camera by using the mouse.

Oasis Mountain forms based on exponential functions and fractal Brownian Motion, which grow and shrink with respect to time.

### When placed in the demo, you can move RIGHT using 'D' to go to the cartoon mountains.  Moving left using 'A' will take you through the Tide Pools and after that, the Desert Oasis Mountains.
